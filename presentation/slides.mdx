## Changes from the original paper

### Announce Event

- Removed the Rotation event.
- Announced by the creator of a group or a trusted participant.

### Independent

- No longer requires metamask.
- Uses WebCrypto API.

<Notes>

The first thing that is different from the original paper is that the rotation
event was removed, and the announce event was added. The announce event does
more than just replaces the rotation event. It is sent by the creator of a group
or a trusted participant in the group. It can contain adifferent of four types:
userJoin, userKick, keyRotation, groupTerminate. The announce event is sent to
all participants in the group. I will explain these four different types in the
next slide.

The next different thing is that this protocol no longer requires metamask in
order to function. The whole protocol now utilizes the WebCrypto API, which has
been made available in all major browsers and javascript runtime under a secure
context(HTTPS).

### Join Event

```typescript
type JoinEventPayload = {
  username: string;
  ecdsaPublicKey: Uint8Array;
  ecdhPublicKey: Uint8Array;
  signature: Uint8Array;
};
```

<Notes>

The Join event creates a new ECDSA and ECDH key pair. Then, the ECDH public key
is exported and signed with the ECDSA private key. The signature is then sent to
the the creator of the group along with the ECDSA public key and the ECDH public
key. The user can also choose their own username.

### Accepted Event

<Notes>

In the Accepted event, the creator of the group along with all the trusted users
verifies the signature in the Join event. When the verification succeeds, the
creator will reply an Accepted event, sending a list of participants to the user
that wants to join the group, and then adding the user to the list of existing
participants. The user will then calculate the shared key with all the existing
participants in the group. When the verification fails, the creator will reply a
Terminate event with the reason "signature not verified", and the user will not
be able to join the group.

# Flow

### Announce Event

```typescript
type AnnounceType =
  | "userJoin"
  | "userStatus"
  | "userKick"
  | "groupTerminate";
```

<Notes>

After the creator of the group has verified the signature, the creator will send
an Announce event with the type userJoin to all the participants in the group,
and everyone in the group will add the user to the list of existing
participants, and then calculate the shared key with the new user. Remember in
the previous slide that trusted users also have to verify the signature? After
the Join event, the trusted users will also send a announce event with the type
userStatus to tell everyone if the signature is valid or not. Note that the
creator of the group holds the final say on whether the signature's validity. If
the signature is invalid, the creator will simply does not announce the user to
the group, and send a termination event with the reason "signature not
verified". A key exchange will not be performed, and the user will not be able
to decrypt messages that are sent to the group.

# Flow

### Beat

```typescript
type BeatEventPayload = {
  timestamp: number;
  to: Uint8Array; // ecdsa public key
};
```

<Notes>

The Beat event is sent by the creator of the group as as well as the trusted
users to all the participants in the group. The purpose of the Beat event is to
make sure that all the participants are still online. If a participant does not
also reply with a Beat event for a certain amount of time, the participant will
be removed from the list of existing participants, and an Announce event with
the type userKick will be sent to all the participants in the group. When that
event is recieved by the participants, they will remove the user from the list
of existing participants, and the shared key with that user is discarded. Since
every participant in the group have a shared key with every other participant,
there will be no need to rotate the keys when a participant leaves the group.

However, if the creator of the group is considered to be offline(which is
verified by all trusted users), the group will be abandoned, and all the
participants will discard the shared key with every other participant in the
group.

### Message

```typescript
export type MessageContent = {
  message: string;
  attachment?: Uint8Array[];
};

export type MessageEventPayload = {
  ciphertext: Uint8Array; // cbor-encoded and encrypted MessageContent
  iv: Uint8Array;
  to: Uint8Array;
  timestamp: number;
};
```

<Notes>

The Message event is sent by a participant to all the other participants in the
group. The message is encrypted with AES-GCM, which is derived from the shared
secret during the ECDH key exchange. The message may also contain attachments.

</Notes>

# Flow

### Terminate Event

```typescript
type TerminateEventPayload = {
  reason: string;
};
```

<Notes>

The terminate event can be sent by any participant in the group. When it is sent
by a participant with the reason "leave", the participant will be removed from
every participant's list, and the shared key with that participant is discarded.
